/// here because the symptom is alarming and the cause is not in this
/// repository.
///
/// After a WAL transaction that leaves a NON-EMPTY freelist in an
/// `auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL` database, SQLite fails every subsequent
/// `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint` on that database with SQLITE_CORRUPT, "database disk
/// image is malformed", for the life of the process -- while `integrity_check`
/// reports `ok` and every read and write succeeds. A checkpoint that can never
/// run means a WAL that grows without bound, so this is not cosmetic.
///
/// The trigger is neither this schema nor one SQLite release. A synthetic
/// database -- create forty tables, insert a row in each, drop them all in one
/// transaction -- reproduces it on 3.45.0, 3.46.0, 3.50.2, 3.53.2, 3.53.3, and
/// 3.53.4 alike, at both 4 KiB and 32 KiB pages. It needs all four of
/// `auto_vacuum=INCREMENTAL`, WAL, a non-empty freelist, and a SQLite built
/// without `SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE` -- `auto_vacuum=NONE`, `auto_vacuum=FULL`,
/// and rollback-journal mode all checkpoint that same workload cleanly, and so
/// does the identical amalgamation compiled with `SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE` or a
/// connection that turns `PRAGMA secure_delete` on before the transaction.
///
/// The mechanism is the database-size sanity check in `walCheckpoint`, not a
/// real corrupt page. Under incremental auto-vacuum, `DROP TABLE` relocates the
/// highest root page down into the slot it is vacating and then frees the
/// vacated page. That page is clean when `freePage2` reaches it, so it is not
/// on the dirty list and gets no WAL frame -- which is correct, because it is a
/// freelist leaf whose content is meaningless. But the checkpointer then finds
/// `nSize + 65536 + mxFrame*szPage < mxPage*szPage`, decides the WAL cannot
/// account for the database's committed page count, and returns
/// `SQLITE_CORRUPT`. `secure_delete` masks it because `freePage2`'s
/// secure-delete branch calls `sqlite3PagerWrite` on every freed page, which
/// dirties it and puts it back in the WAL. A distribution `sqlite3` binary
/// checkpoints the same workload without complaint for that reason;
/// `libsqlite3-sys` does not define `SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE`.
///
/// `.agents/docs/sqlite-wal-incremental-vacuum-checkpoint-report.md` holds the
/// standalone C reproduction, the measured page and frame counts behind that
/// arithmetic, and the version matrix. Issue #2789 tracks whether to close the
/// class structurally with `secure_delete` instead.
///
/// What changed on our side is that migration 0033 rewrites every fact table,
/// so it is the first migration in this chain to leave a freelist behind at
/// all; every schema before it committed with `freelist_count = 0`.
///
/// One incremental-vacuum step is enough to clear the state, and draining the
/// list is what a rewrite migration should do anyway: it hands the old schema's
/// pages back to the filesystem instead of leaving the store permanently larger
/// than its contents. The loop is needed because the same defect makes
/// `incremental_vacuum(0)` free one page per call instead of all of them.
///
/// `free_pages_under_incremental_auto_vacuum_still_break_wal_checkpoints` is
/// the tripwire: it pins the upstream condition, so it starts failing when a
