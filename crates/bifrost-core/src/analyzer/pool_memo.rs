//! Pool-safe lazy memoization for analyzer-level caches.
//!
//! Analyzer-level lazy caches whose initializers use rayon must use
//! [`PoolSafeMemo`] rather than blocking primitives such as `OnceLock::get_or_init`.
//! These caches may be reached from inside rayon worker threads during whole-workspace
//! parallel scans. Blocking those workers while another initializer waits on rayon can
//! deadlock the pool. Whole-workspace `par_iter` scans should also pre-materialize any
//! such indexes they can touch before entering the scan.
//!
//! Callers *off* the pool can block safely, so they wait for an in-flight build
//! instead of duplicating it -- a background warmer and the first request no
//! longer race two whole-workspace builds against each other. Only rayon
//! workers fall back to a duplicate serial build (first write wins).
//!
//! A background warm can lift that last restriction with
//! [`PoolSafeMemo::get_or_build_on_dedicated_pool`]: the build runs on a pool of
//! this module's own, so it reaches completion without any global-pool worker
//! and a global-pool worker that reaches the same memo can wait for it. Without
//! that, a whole-workspace index build started off the request path is still
//! duplicated -- serially -- by the first request whose parallel fan-out
//! touches the index (issue #1757).
//!
//! Running on the dedicated pool is one way to reach a value without a
//! global-pool worker, not the only one. A build that is pure store I/O -- a
//! SQLite read on its own reader connection -- also reaches its value with no
//! rayon worker at all, so a global-pool worker may park on it for exactly the
//! same reason. [`PoolSafeMemo::get_or_try_build_pool_independent`] is that
//! claim, and [`KeyedPoolSafeMemo`] applies it per key to the request-scoped
//! read-through memos whose stampede it exists to stop (issue #1748).
