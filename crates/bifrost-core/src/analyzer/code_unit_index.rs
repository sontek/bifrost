//! The read-only index over a project's declarations.
//!
//! [`CodeUnitIndex`] is the half of the analyzer contract that answers from the
//! declaration index alone: enumerating declarations, resolving names to them,
//! rendering their sources, skeletons and signatures, navigating parent/child
//! structure, and answering which declaration encloses a source location.
//! Every signature here closes over this crate's model
//! types, which is what lets it sit below `brokk-bifrost-analysis` and lets
//! generic index consumers (`capabilities`, `pool_memo`) live here too.
//!
//! `IAnalyzer` in `brokk-bifrost-analysis` extends this trait and retains
//! everything that needs a grammar, a store, the usages framework or the
//! language registry -- including the batched symbol search, whose request type
//! owns compiled `regex` values.
